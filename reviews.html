              <h4>I've just returned from an incredible trip to Iceland organised by travel agency "Follow me" and can't help but share my experiences!
                From the very beginning, everything was at the highest level. The agency helped me plan a route that perfectly combined active adventure and leisure time. I visited such stunning places as Gullfoss Falls, Geyser Geyser and, of course, the famous iceberg lagoon in Jokulsarlon. Every day was filled with new discoveries and exciting moments!
                The guides were real professionals and shared interesting facts about the culture and nature of Iceland. I especially remembered the tour of the Golden Ring, where we saw not only natural wonders, but also learned a lot about local legends and myths.
                Separately, I want to note that the agency took care of my comfort: all hotels were cozy and located in picturesque places. I was even able to see the northern lights right from the window of my room - it was magical!Thank you!</h4>

              <h4>I recently returned from an amazing trip to Norway organized by "Follow me" travel agency and want to share my impressions!
                From the very beginning, everything was organized at the highest level. The agency helped me create a route that perfectly combined active adventure and the opportunity to enjoy nature. I visited such magnificent places as the Nerojfjord fjeld, the Voringsfoss waterfall and, of course, the famous Lofoten Islands. Every day was full of new discoveries and exciting moments!
                The guides were real professionals who shared interesting facts about Norway's culture and history. I especially remember the fjords tour, where we not only enjoyed the stunning views, but also learned a lot about the local flora and fauna.
                I also want to note that the agency took care of my comfort: all hotels were cozy and located in picturesque places. I was even able to see the northern lights during one of the nights - it was unforgettable!
